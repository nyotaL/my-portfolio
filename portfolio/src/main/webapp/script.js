              And your shoulder will bend.<br>\

            Useless synonym of truth<br>\
            Of human essence,<br>\

            Wine with a cork squeezed in<br>\
            Narrow throat of the bottle.<br>\
            Semisweet.<br>\

            I imagine the night.<br>\
            Humps of furniture, shadows of branches<br>\
            On the wall by my bed,<br>\
            There are no curtains to cover up<br>\
            Moon light source-<br>\
            I cuddle the toy harder.<br>\

            Out of context. Outside the veins, in the veins,<br>\
            On the floor, on my hands. Somewhere.<br>\
            It's taste of iron pillars,<br>\
            Color darkening gradually,<br>\
            How hypnotic this color is.<br>\
            <br>\
            I also imagine pain.<br>\
            Pain of all pains without specification,<br>\
            If I were pain, I'd crawl through the space<br>\
            Between the neck and the head.<br>\
            And I would live there forever<br>\
            As a curved eighth vertebra.<br>\

            In nudity through a layer of attire,<br>\
            That experience is frail,<br>\
            Words are antics,<br>\
            That the meaning is a leaking look.<br>\
